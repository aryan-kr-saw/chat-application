## Note
- Please  note that we will require two different browsers to login as two different users because after login for the first time it will store the user credentials in local storage(hence it will be always logged in with same user) of the browser so in the same browser it will not allow to login as different user. 

## User Credentials 
- For 1st user: Username: user1 , Password:12345
- For 2nd user: Username: user2 , Password:12345
